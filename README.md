## :abcd: How it works

#### :gem: Select a playlist
To see the playlists click on 'Playlists':

<img src="/readme_imgs/playlist_but.PNG" width="160" height="80">

And you will see the playlists that are already created and there are videos on them.

<img src="/readme_imgs/playlists.PNG" width="500" height="200">

After that you can click on a playlist.

#### :gem: Search video

You can search the videos at:

<img src="/readme_imgs/search.PNG" width="170" height="80">

Press Enter and the results will appear like this:

<img src="/readme_imgs/search_results.PNG" width="550" height="300">

Select what video you want. :pushpin:

## :zap: How to create new playlists

Click on 'FavPl':

<img src="/readme_imgs/favpl.PNG" width="160" height="80">

And the form to create a playlist and to add videos to a playlist will appear:

<img src="/readme_imgs/form_post.PNG" width="500" height="300">

Complete the form and press submit to create a playlist and add a video to it or to add a video to a playlist that already exist.
